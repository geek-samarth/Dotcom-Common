<h2 class="sec-head">WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h2>
We, as well as our business partners, collect information about your use of our website through cookies. Cookies are information files stored on your computer, tablet, or smartphone that help websites remember who you are and information about your visits. Cookies can help to display the information on a website in a way that matches your interests. Most major websites use cookies.
<h2 class="sec-head">WHAT COOKIES ARE USED ON THIS WEBSITE?</h2>
<strong>The cookies that we use on this website are broadly grouped into the following categories:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Essential</strong> – Some of the cookies on our website are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of this would be a cookie used to enable you to log into your account on the website or which allows communication between your browser and the website. You may not be able to use our website without these cookies.</li>
 	<li><strong>Analytics</strong> – We use analytics cookies to help us understand how users engage with our website. An example is counting the number of different people coming to our website or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or feature is used. Without this cookie, for instance, we would count you as three separate users if you visited the site three different times, making it difficult to analyze how well our website is performing or improve it without these cookies in place.</li>
 	<li><strong>User Cookies</strong> – We use these cookies to improve your experience by remembering your preferences so we know how you like to use our website. Examples of this would be remembering you so that you are served with the same content or to remember you when you come back to the site.</li>
 	<li><strong>Social Sharing</strong> – We use third-party cookies to allow you to share content directly on the social networking/sharing sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. Examples would be if you wanted to “like” or “tweet” about us or our products and/or services. Please see the “Third Party Cookies” section below for more details.</li>
 	<li><strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong> – You will have noticed that when you visit websites, you are shown adverts for products and services you may wish to purchase. The money made by website owners for showing third-party adverts on their websites often pays for the cost of running the website and therefore usually allows you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. To try to ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you, third-party cookies may be used to collect information about the types of things that interest you. For example, websites you visit and the geography you are based in may play a factor in the adverts you see. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes them more relevant to you. Please see our “Third Party Cookies” section below for more details.</li>
</ul>
